# Binary Search Tree Interactive Implementation

This program creates a binary search tree with user inputted values, outputs some information regarding the tree, and allows users to insert additional values and erase existing values from the tree. The program then converts the tree's values to a binary code which represents each value's place in the tree.

The program uses an TreeIterator class, which traverses various connected TreeNodes in the BinarySearchTree. The program makes use of operator overloading, friend classes, member functions, pointers

To use, either run the Unix executable file or compile the source code yourself.
