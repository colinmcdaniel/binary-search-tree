# Binary Search Tree Interactive Implementation

* [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/colinmcdaniel/binary-search-tree)

## Functionality

This program creates a binary search tree with user inputted values, outputs some information regarding the tree, and allows users to insert additional values and erase existing values from the tree. The program then converts the tree's values to a binary code which represents each value's place in the tree.

The program uses an TreeIterator class, which traverses various connected TreeNodes in the BinarySearchTree. The program makes use of recursion, operator overloading, friend classes, member functions, and pointers.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Either simply run the Unix executable file, or compile the source code yourself and run.
