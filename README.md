# Binary Search Tree Interactive Implementation

This program gets nonnegative integers from the user and inserts them to a binary search tree, outputs some information regarding the tree, and then converts some numbers to binary code based on their place in the tree.

To use, either run the Unix executable file or compile the source code yourself.
